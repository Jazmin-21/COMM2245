<h2>PROFILE</h2>

My name is Jazmin Molinar. 
I am a senior double majoring in English and Communication and Journalism with a concentration in strategic communication. 
I am from Los Lunas, New Mexico. I am striving to be a journalist and write about celebrities. 
I also would like to start working locally and then branch my way to different states in the future. 
I have always been interested in celebrity news as well as other areas. 
Some things that I did for fun were sports I used to gymnastics, swimming, and kickboxing.

<h2>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>

I do not have any prior related experience in web design. I am planning to intern at a local company to gain experience in my journalism career this year. 
It will not only help me gain expericence in journalism it will also help me gain experience in web design. 
Besides gaining knowledge on web design in the past I have done volunteer work for my local community all throughout my highschool. 
It was an amazing and fun experience. I learned so much about myself through volunteering.
